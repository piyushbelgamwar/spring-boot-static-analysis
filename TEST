**JIRA Comment:**  

We need to ensure that XML validation does not allow elements with only whitespace.  

Here’s what we have tried so far:  

1. **Converting InputStream to Reader** – Did not work as expected because it reads in binary and does not normalize whitespace.  
2. **Modifying the XSD Schema** – This is not an option since the team has decided not to change the schema.  
3. **Using Saxon’s Whitespace Stripping** – We are working on this approach using `TransformFactory` to remove unnecessary spaces before validation.  
4. **Adding a Custom Validation Step** – We are also working on a post-validation check to detect elements containing only whitespace and throw an error.  

We will proceed with **Approach 3 and 4** to enforce stricter validation without modifying the XSD.
